# Visual Analytics project 2020/2021


Our project focuses on the analysis of the airplane accidents occurred in the last century. 
The main goal of our project is to try to highlight, if any, correlations between accidents and companies, time of the day, location of the casualty and route of the aircraft, including statistics like fatality rate for user definible time ranges (year, decades and various in between).  

## Visualizations
[ ] Dot Density Map: 
    map with a dot for each accidents located on a world map at its location. The user can choose the range of years (only accidents in the range will be highlighted dots) and the choice of range is going to influence the histograms;
[ ] Line Chart: 
    a chart to visualize number of fatalities (aboard or ground or both, user selectable) per year;
[ ] Stacked Histogram: 
    an histogram to visualize the number of accidents per year, stacked per flight operator in order to have a better visualization or stacked per day or night (user definible stack parameter);
[x] Word Tree: 
    word tree showing the correlation between multiple words in the accident summary;
[x] Word Cloud: 
    word cloud showing the most relevant word found on the accident summary.
